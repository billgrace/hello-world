Time to learn github in some depth...
I have never taken the time to really understand git or github in any depth - I've just needed a (supposedly) convenient way to have back ups to code I'm working on and (hopefully) a way to recover earlier versions of that code.
Soooo... here I am intending to take the time to thoroughly traverse the docs.github.com site and really learn how to work with it properly.
*FYI - I was more or less forced into this when I started a new project on my local system and wanted to make it into a github repository and could not figure out how to tell my local git install (working on a Mac Mini M1 in my office) how to use my github login username and password.*
All the stuff I managed to google and grok didn't really help much - 
**SOOOooo...**
